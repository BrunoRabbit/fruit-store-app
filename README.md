# Fruit store app

The main objective of this project is to be a stock controller in which the user adds a fruit to the cart and can buy it.

<h6>Obviously, first of all I asked if I could do.</h6>
This project has been around for a long time, there were some breaks due to college, as soon as it was over I decided to go back to the project.

I used __Firebase__ resources, in addition I used object-oriented programming (OOP).
The first idea was not to integrate the cart values for each user in Firebase. The idea was to store them via sqflite, since I had already studied about it.
